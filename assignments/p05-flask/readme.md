# Project 5 - Flask Assignment
For this assignment, you must build some sort of web-based application.  
If you don't have any good ideas, begin with the [starter code](https://github.com/HSU-S21-CS232/p05-examples).  

## Basic Requirements
* Expose an endpoint for searching for music:
    * by name (implemented)
    * by artist
    * by genre
    * by year
    * by album
* Be able to add tracks to a "shopping cart"
    * We need to be able to add, remove, and clear a cart
* Be able to "check out"
    * Convert the current shopping cart into an invoice in the DB
        *This will also create one or more invoice items
## Additional Requirements (options, do what you find interesting)
* Implement user authentication (e.g. user name = customer email and password = phone number)
    * Before you can check out, the user must be logged in first
* Develop an HTML front-end for this application

## Grading
This assignment is worth 100 points.  Your grade will be based on the following:
* Completing the project *_OR_*
* Demonstrating regular progress as evident by a) consistent Github checkins and b) issue tracking and/or progress board updates
* Maintaining a [design diary](design_diary_prompts.md) for this assignment (place in the root of your project repository)

## Due Date
This assignment is due midnight, April 16, 2020.  You will turn in your project by checking your code into github, submitting a link to that repository on Canvas. Next, create an GIF walkthrough of your program using [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) (also available as a standalone EXE in this project's [utility folder](../../utils)).  Upload this image to your repository and put a link to the image in your reflection. *Be sure to place your reflection in _the root folder_ of your repository!*
