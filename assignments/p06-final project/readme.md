# Project 6 - Flask Assignment
This is your final project.  You may work on anything that you'd like as long as the primary focus is Python development.  
Your project will be graded based on complexity and effort.  It will be easier to obtain an A on a complex project that 
you didn't finish compared to a simplistic project that you did finish.
