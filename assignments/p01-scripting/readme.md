# Project 1 - Basic Scripting
* Write a script to make your life easier.  If you can't think of anything do thisâ€¦

1. Extend the file processing example in some interesting way.  For example, you could use [eyeD3](https://eyed3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to bulk adjust albums, artists, and song titles for MP3 music. 
2. Use [pywinauto](https://pywinauto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to automate a graphical task in Windows.  
3. Use [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) to automate some web task.  For example, you could write a script that automatically saves the top story in the New York Times as a PDF.  
4. Use [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to query a REST API.  The [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) is free and is pretty well documented.  It would be cool if you created a basic user "dashboard" that showed recent activity on GitHub (commits, issue comments, etc.).

## Buddy Assignments
See Canvas for buddy assignments

## Grading
This assignment is worth 40 points.  Your grade will be based on the following:
* Completing the project *_OR_*
* Demonstrating regular progress as evident by a) consistent Github checkins and b) issue tracking and/or progress board updates
* Maintaining a [design diary](design_diary_prompts.md) for this assignment (place in the root of your project repository)
* Completing a [buddy progress report](buddy_report.md) for each of your buddies.  You will submit your buddy report confidentially through Canvas.

## Due Date
This assignment is due midnight, February 5, 2020.  You will turn in your project by checking your code into github, submitting a link to that repository on Canvas, and submitting your buddy reports. Next, create an GIF walkthrough of your program using [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) (also available as a standalone EXE in this project's [utility folder](../../utils)).  Upload this image to your repository and put a link to the image in your reflection. *Be sure to place your reflection in _the root folder_ of your repository!*
