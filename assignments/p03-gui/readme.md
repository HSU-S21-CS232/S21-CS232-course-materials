# Project 3 - Building GUIs in Python using QT
In this assignment, you will build a basic graphical application using the cross platform (and cross language!) QT GUI tools. For this, you will need the following:
* [Download QT](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)  ([Offline installer](https://www.qt.io/offline-installers))
* [Pyside2 QT bindings](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/)

## Requirements 
You are tasked with developing something cool.  If you can't think of anything, cool, you can implement the music player described below.

## Default Option: Develop a basic music player in QT
Included in the same folder as this readme is a starter QT for Python application that allows users to load and play sound files.  Note that in order to play MP3 files, I had to install the correct MP3 codecs onto my computer.  The [K-Lite](https://www.codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_basic.htm) codec pack has all of what you need to play various music files on your machine.

If you go this option, you need to add volume controls as well as proper play/stop capabilities to the music player.  As a bonus, try adding a playlist feature with the ability to skip between songs!  

In building the basic prototype, I referred to the [QMediaPlayer](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/PySide2/QtMultimedia/QMediaPlayer.html?highlight=qmediaplayer#PySide2.QtMultimedia.QMediaPlayer) documentation and [QT Audio Overview](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/audiooverview.html) page.

## Buddy Assignments
Check canvas to find your buddy for this assignment.

## Grading
This assignment is worth 70 points.  Your grade will be based on the following:
* Completing the project *_OR_*
* Demonstrating regular progress as evident by a) consistent Github checkins and b) issue tracking and/or progress board updates
* Maintaining a [design diary](design_diary_prompts.md) for this assignment (place in the root of your project repository)
* Completing a [buddy progress report](buddy_report.md) for each of your buddies.  You will submit your buddy report confidentially through Canvas.

## Due Date
This assignment is due midnight, March 12, 2021.  You will turn in your project by checking your code into github, submitting a link to that repository on Canvas, and submitting your buddy reports. Next, create an GIF walkthrough of your program using [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) (also available as a standalone EXE in this project's [utility folder](../../utils)).  Upload this image to your repository and put a link to the image in your reflection. *Be sure to place your reflection in _the root folder_ of your repository!*
