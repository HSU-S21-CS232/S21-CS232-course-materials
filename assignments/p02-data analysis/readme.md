# HW #2
For this assignment, you will delve into the basics of data analysis using Python.  As always, you are welcome to select a topic or area that is of particular interest to you.  If you cannot think of anything in particular, you can analyze the dataset that I provide.  This dataset contains historic death rates in the US.  Your task is to discover trends in the data.  

Please create a new repository in the course's github organization.  The name of your project should be in the format ```p02-{HSU Login}```.  For example, mine would be p02-asc564.

## Minimum Requirements
Your assignment will be graded based both on the script you develop to answer your questions as well as the writeup you provide.  The writeup should be in a Juypter notebook file.  Your code can also be there, but you may need to write separate scripts as well.  I leave that up to you.  In order to receive full credit, you must provide statistical analysis for the questions that I provide in the overview.  If you are doing your own analysis, you will be expected to provide an equivalent level of data analysis for your chosen dataset.

## Grading
This assignment is worth 50 points.  Your grade will be based on the following:
* Completing the project *_OR_*
* Demonstrating regular progress as evident by a) consistent Github checkins and b) issue tracking and/or progress board updates
* Maintaining a [design diary](../design_diary_prompts.md) for this assignment (place in the root of your project repository)
* Completing a [buddy progress report](../buddy_report.md) for each of your buddies.  You will submit your buddy report confidentially through Canvas.

## Due Date
This assignment is due midnight, February 19, 2021.  You will turn in your project by checking your code into github and submitting your design diary and buddy report on Canvas. Next, create an GIF walkthrough of your program using [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) (also available as a standalone EXE in this project's [utility folder](../../utils)).  Upload this image to your repository and put a link to the image in your reflection.
